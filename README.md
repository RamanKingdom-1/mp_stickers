All files created here were my own work aside from 

HSLAPixel.h
HSLAPixel.cpp
PNG.cpp
PNG.h
RGB_HSL.h

Those were given by course staff but they are the base on which the rest of the code was built on

The given code is supposed to create an image and then allow other images to be added to it as if they were stickers being pasted on the picture
